# Frontend Security Best Practices (Based on OWASP Top 10)

## 1. Broken Access Control  
- Ensure proper **authorization checks** on both frontend and backend.  
- Hide UI elements for unauthorized users, but always enforce access control on the backend.  
- Prevent **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)** by not exposing sensitive IDs in URLs without validation.  

## 2. Cryptographic Failures  
- Avoid storing sensitive data like passwords or tokens in **localStorage** (use **HttpOnly cookies** instead).  
- Use **HTTPS** to encrypt all data in transit.  
- Implement **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent data leaks.  

## 3. Injection Attacks (e.g., XSS)  
- Always **sanitize and escape user input** before rendering it in the UI.  
- Use frameworks like **React/Vue** that automatically escape HTML.  
- Implement **CSP (Content Security Policy)** to prevent malicious scripts.  
- Avoid using `innerHTML` unless absolutely necessary (and sanitize input first).  

## 4. Insecure Design  
- Apply **security-first design** when building features (e.g., avoid relying on frontend validation alone).  
- Implement **rate limiting and CAPTCHAs** for sensitive actions like login.  

## 5. Security Misconfiguration  
- Disable **debugging tools** in production (e.g., React Developer Tools, Vue DevTools).  
- Remove sensitive information from **error messages** and API responses.  
- Set **secure HTTP headers** (e.g., `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`).  

## 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components  
- Regularly update **frontend dependencies** (npm/yarn packages).  
- Check for vulnerabilities using tools like **npm audit** or **Snyk**.  
- Avoid using unmaintained third-party libraries.  

## 7. Identification and Authentication Failures  
- Use **secure authentication flows** (OAuth, JWT, or session-based auth).  
- Implement **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** where possible.  
- Enforce **strong password policies** on the frontend.  
- Logout users properly by clearing authentication tokens securely.  

## 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures  
- Use **Subresource Integrity (SRI)** when loading third-party scripts.  
- Verify dependencies with **package signing** when possible.  
- Avoid loading JavaScript from untrusted CDNs.  

## 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures  
- Implement client-side **error tracking** (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket).  
- Alert users of suspicious activities (e.g., login from a new device).  

## 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - Not frontend-relevant  
- Mostly a backend issue, but be cautious when sending user-supplied URLs to your API.
